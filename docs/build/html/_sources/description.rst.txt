Orange County Lettings is a start-up in the real estate rental sector. Being expanding in the 
United States, the company decided to expand its team. As a developer, you need to play an 
important role in improving the company’s site, both in terms of code and deployment.
I had access to the site’s `GitHub repository <https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Python-OC-Lettings-FR>`_.

My mission is to set up and operate the site locally on my computer. 
Following the instructions of the README, it is possible to:

* Run the site locally and browse it in a browser.
* I can log in and use the Admin section of the site.
* Consult the database and launch queries.
* Run the linting locally.
* Run the test suite locally.
