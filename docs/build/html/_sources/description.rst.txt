Orange County Lettings recruited me to play a key role in improving the website, code and deployment.

After evaluating the technologies currently used in the application code, the technical director, identified various problems to solve. 
During our first meeting with him, I had access 
to the siteâ€™s `GitHub repository <https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Python-OC-Lettings-FR>`_.

My mission is to set up and operate the site locally on my computer. Following the instructions of the README, it is possible to:

* Run the site locally and browse it in a browser.
* I can log in and use the Admin section of the site.
* Consult the database and launch queries.
* Run the linting locally.
* Run the test suite locally.
